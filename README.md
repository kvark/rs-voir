Reservoir logic for understanding spatio/tempral resampling.

[ReSTIR](https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2020-07_spatiotemporal-reservoir-resampling-real-time-ray-tracing-dynamic-direct), or Spatio-Temporal Reservoir Resampling, is the mathematical basis for a new generation of Ray Tracing engines. This new generation aims to produce photo-realistic images in real-time by using smart math for re-using the previous computations.

Understanding it is key to try yourself in this new area. However, diving into the research papers can be challenging. To help, I created this repository to implement the basics of reservoirs in Rust.
